You're almost there! ✅ This is a **very good start**, but a few cleanups and fixes will make it fully ready to paste into your `README.md` on GitHub.

Here’s the **corrected and finalized version** you can **directly copy-paste** into your `README.md` file:

# 📊 Digital Inclusion and Consumption Inequality in India

This project investigates the link between **digital inclusion (e.g., internet access, e-commerce usage)** and **consumption inequality** in India using micro-level household data from the **NSSO Household Consumption Expenditure Surveys (HCES) 2022–23 and 2023–24**.

The goal is to build a reproducible, data-driven research pipeline using **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **machine learning techniques** that goes beyond traditional regression — helping understand whether digital access leads to better living standards.
